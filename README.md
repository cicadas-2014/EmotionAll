We are always connecting, but are we really connected? 

We at EmotionAll feel that the answer to this question lies in the very data we are so often confronted with thanks to social media: twitter feeds, facebook posts and instagram tags are all examples of ways we are expressing ourselves in order to connect to others, both near and far. 

At the heart of these connections is an emotion, just as emotions are at the center of our own heart. EmotionAll is about distilling the emotions of the world down to one, single thing: a color. 

Our website offers a cutting-edge approach to data visualization by analyzing tweets for the most pressing world issues (represented by trending topics). Thanks to the powerful AlchemyAPI, we can distill these posts down to a single emotion, either positive or negative, and then portray it in an aesthetically-pleasing, yet intellectually-provactive way. 

Maybe, in the end, we don't all think and feel as differently as we are led to believe. Why not come see ? 

EmotionAll

We #laugh / #dance / #sing / #cry as one. 

************************** 

### What it is 

EmotionAll is an interactive data-visualization site that dynamically generates world maps, which feature overlays signifying either the positive or negative feeling of that location to a specific topic. Users can choose a trending topic from Twitter which then populates the map with a 'hot / cold' display of each country's disposition towards the affair. 

### What it does 

EmotionAll takes advantage of the Twitter API in order to pull down large amounts of tweets for various trending topics, and then parses this information for sentiment via AlchemyAPI. This coupled with a 'coloring' algorithm that  shades an area based on its relative positivity or negativity allow the program to paint a picture on the global scale of just how the world is feeling, at this moment, for any number of events. 

### How to use it 

Simply visit the EmotionAll website and choose a trending topic of your choice. Then sit back and watch as the program dynamically colors the world to represent the current 'state of affairs' when it comes to any and all issues. Care to see another? Just select again. It's that easy.

Choose away. And learn. Because maybe we just aren't so different after all.
