We are always connecting, but are we really connected? 

We at EmotionAll feel that the answer to this question lies in the very data we are so often confronted with thanks to social media: twitter feeds, facebook posts and instagram tags are all examples of ways we are expressing ourselves in order to connect to others, both near and far. 

At the heart of these connections is an emotion, just as emotions are at the center of our own heart. EmotionAll is about distilling the emotions of the world down to one, single thing: a color. 

Our website offers a cutting-edge approach to data visualization by analyzing tweets for the most pressing world issues (represented by trending topics). Thanks to the powerful AlchemyAPI, we can distill these posts down to a single emotion, either positive or negative, and then portray it in an aesthetically-pleasing, yet intellectually-provactive way. 

Maybe, in the end, we don't all think and feel as differently as we are led to believe. Why not come see ?
