        <h3>EmotionAll collects emotional data from Twitter and organizes it visually so that you might understand how the rest of the world feels about just about anything.</h3>

        <h3>EmotionAll utilizes the intrinsically emotional nature of our interactions and works to showcase this insight in a novel and exciting way. By analyzing Twitter trends and their tweets for sentiment value thanks to <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com" target="_blank">AlchemyAPI</a>, the application is able to extract emotions from otherwise mechanical social media interactions. This data is then charted to a 'heat-map' of the world, which serves to dynamically display the current emotional state of any country in relation to a top Twitter trend.<br></h3>
        <h3>This data is fascinating. The implications are staggering. And it is the information that really speaks for itself â€” maybe we aren't so different from one another after all.</h3>

            <dd>This application was created as our final project at Dev Bootcamp. 
Our journey together helped us better appreciate the emotions that tie us together. 
While analyzing emotional trends on a national or global scale is a great experience,
we want to always remember the importance of encouraging one another. So if you see someone feeling down, give them a good word of encouragement.
We hope every life trends in the positive direction.
